= Introduction =

Throughout the sprints when issues arise, they are to be dealt with immediately. These issues can include impediments discovered during the weekly meetings, bugs, or change requests. When dealing with bugs and other high priority issues, they are to be resolved before the feature they are associated with is signed off.

*Issue Tracking Workflow*
- Open a new issue through the google code project page <br/>
- Fill out the summary and description of the issue <br/>
- Cc to relevant team members <br/>
- Make sure the issue type and priority are set accordingly <br/>
- Submit the issue <br/>
<br/>
After the issue has been submitted:<br/>
- I (Adam) will assign the issue to a team member based on the workload of the team members at the time<br/>
<br/>
After the issue has been resolved:<br/>
- The two team members that have not assigned or submitted the issue will then sign the issue off.<br/>
- Issue page is then updated.

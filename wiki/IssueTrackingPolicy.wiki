= Introduction =

Throughout the sprints when issues arise, they are to be dealt with immediately. These issues can include impediments discovered during the weekly meetings, bugs, or change requests. When dealing with bugs and other high priority issues, they are to be resolved before the feature they are associated with is signed off.
